AI Chatbot Assistant Project
This project implements a customizable AI chatbot assistant in Python, trained on user-provided data (such as documents and images), with a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend uses Flask to serve the API, OpenAI for the language model, and LangChain for data retrieval and querying. It's designed for easy setup and extension, allowing the chatbot to respond based on your custom dataset.

Features
Chatbot Logic: Uses OpenAI's GPT model for generating responses.

Data Training: Indexes documents (e.g., PDFs) using LangChain and FAISS for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling the AI to reference your data.

Frontend: A simple web-based chat interface with real-time messaging via JavaScript and AJAX.

Backend: Flask server handling API requests for chat interactions.

Extensibility: Supports adding image processing or more advanced features.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ install

An OpenAI API key (sign up at OpenAI's website and set it as an environment variable: export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here').

Required libraries: Install via pip install openai langchain langchain-openai faiss-cpu pypdf flask.

Installation
Clone or create the project folder with the structure above.

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (create a requirements.txt with the libraries listed in Prerequisites).

Prepare your data: Place documents (e.g., PDFs) in a folder and update data_folder in ai.py to point to it.

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.

Usage
Run the backend server: python ai.py.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Type messages in the input field and send them – the chatbot will respond using your trained data.

For testing without data, you can swap trained_chatbot_response with a basic OpenAI call in ai.py.

Example Interaction
User: "Summarize the main points from my document."

Assistant: (Responds based on indexed data from your folder.)

Customization
Add Image Support: Integrate libraries like pytesseract to extract text from images and add them to the document loader.

Advanced Models: Switch to "gpt-4" in the OpenAI calls for better performance (update in ai.py).

Deployment: Host on platforms like Heroku or Render by adding a Procfile and configuring for production.

Styling: Modify styles.css for custom themes or add more JS features in script.js (e.g., file uploads).

Troubleshooting
API Key Issues: Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set correctly.

Data Loading Errors: Verify file paths and formats; only PDFs are handled by default – extend the loader for other types.

Server Not Starting: Check for port conflicts or missing libraries.

If responses are generic, ensure your data folder has relevant documents and re-run the indexing.
